<td>Patient is a 55 year old male with no past medical history who presents with complaint of sudden onset of left-sided nonradiating chest discomfort of sudden onset approximately 1 hour prior to presentation while doing administrative work at rest.    He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient&#39;s Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  Cardiology felt that patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease have recommended discharge home with aspirin and Plavix with outpatient stress testing given his positive Covid testing.  At the time of discharge patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient was borderline diabetic with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1.  Patient was discharged home with Metformin along with glucometer, glucose strip, lancets.  Given patient&#39;s tachycardia patient&#39;s Metformin 25 mg twice daily was changed to Toprol 25 mg daily. (Please note clarification in comparison to discharge home med list.  Toprol XL 25 mg daily was called to pharmacy in place of the metoprolol.)</td>

<td>The vaccine was received at 1:12 PM, and I felt fairly fine, aside from injection site pain and some tingling in my left arm  until I had sudden significant elevation of heart rate, with shortness of breath, and throat swelling/tightening at approximately 1:26PM.  I cold compress was applied to my forehead and I was put in a reclining position &amp; then received Epinephrine at 1:28PM. EMS (present onsite) arrived for transport at 1:31PM. 4L of oxygen was applied after O2 sat of 89% noted by EMS. Blood pressure was elevated to &gt;200/100 initially by EMS. Symptoms improved quickly following epinephrine, with some residual feelings of very mild throat fullness, and I developed chills which improved over time.  I was transported to emergency department where I was evaluated (symptoms mostly resolved at that time, but ED physician noted a little swelling remaining in my uvula), then IV Benadryl and Decadron were given. Later acetaminophen was also given for headache that developed during my ED stay.  My vitals were monitored throughout and observation occurred until I was discharged at approximately 5:00PM, as symptoms had not recurred.</td>

Following C1D1 Kanjinti/Taxol on 10/16/20, her cough, which developed in to shortness of breath, progressively worsened. Symptoms continued to worsen through the next two cycles to the point where she was barely able to walk from her bed to the bathroom.

<td>burst blood vessel in left eye/blood in her eye; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 35-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EH9899, expiry date 01Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine location was left deltoid. The facility type vaccine was hospital. Medical history included ongoing rheumatoid arthritis for about 8 years. No known allergies.

A 29-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (lot number EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 12:00 at 29 years old at single dose at Left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Mirena IUD, personal and family history of retinal migraines (without headache). The concomitant medications were magnesium citrate, melatonin, ademetionine (SAME) and fish oil. On 18Dec2020 in the AM, developed progressive severe soreness at injection site, worse than any other vaccine, hurt even just the touch. This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improved. There was no swelling, redness, or other local symptoms. In the afternoon on 18Dec2020, she developed significant loss of mental clarity (brain fog) while at work. In the evening on 18Dec2020, developed mild retroorbital headache (this was actually the first headache of my life). All day 19Dec2020 and about half the day of 20Dec2020 developed a migraine (also the first of my life), experienced as retroorbital pounding headache, sensitivity to light and sound in 19Dec2020, nausea without vomiting in 19Dec2020, and loss of mental clarity. She had intermittent mild tension type frontal headache on 20Dec2020 PM with all other symptoms resolved, all symptoms resolved by 21Dec2020 AM. The patient used naproxen 440 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg on 19Dec2020. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was not Allergic to medications, food, or other products. The outcome of the events was recovered on 21Dec2020.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, the reported loss of mental clarity together with other events was likely related to the first dose BNT162B2 due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

A 44-year-old female patient received single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685, Expiry Date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 for immunization. The vaccine was given roughly around 4:30PM at the left arm. Vaccination Facility Type: Hospital. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. Medical history included underlying condition of Lymphoma. It was treated in 2017 and she has been off all medications since 2018. Patient had no relevant family medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no medications in over 2 years. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient had right sided Bell&#39;s Palsy on an unspecified date in Dec2020 (Either Sunday or Monday, so either the 20th or 21st) wherein she got pain in the right ear. She thought she had an ear infection. She treated herself with antibiotics. 7 days later, she noticed weakness. On day 8, which would have been 26Dec2020, she had complete paralysis. It was ongoing. It was stable, but hard to tell. Patient went to the ER on 26Dec2020 for facial droop. She went to Physician office at Urgent Care on 25Dec2020 thinking it was an ear infection. On 23Dec2020 she had lymph node swelling on right side of neck. that was probably after the ear and she didn&#39;t worry about it. She thought maybe it was an infection. It started between onset of ear pain and Bell&#39;s Palsy. On 26Dec2020, she had intermittent tingling in right arm. She noticed it on the same day as facial paralysis. She doesn&#39;t notice any weakness in the arm. Patient had recent blood work (results and date not reported). The patient considered the events as serious: medically significant. The outcome of lymph node swelling on the ride side of her neck was recovering (was also reported to be ongoing at the time of reporting), while the other events was not recovered. The physician considered the events related to the Pfizer product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the events facial paralysis, tingling in right arm, and lymph node swelling on right side of her neck with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded based on the limited information.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &quot;none&quot;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 23-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EK9231, intramuscular in the right deltoid, first dose on 27Dec2020 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 prevention. Medical history included ongoing asthma and reactive airway which she was diagnosed when she was like 5 years old (2002). Concomitant medication included albuterol [salbutamol] for asthma which started when she was 8 years old or so. The patient wanted to know if she can receive the second dose of covid vaccine after experiencing symptoms of allergic reaction like rash, tightness in throat, and lump in throat. She wanted to know the ingredients and specific proteins in the covid vaccine. The patient received the COVID Vaccine and she developed a reaction. On 27Dec2020, she had a red rash on her chest, and her cheeks were flushed, and the rash was on her arms too, and she had a tightness and lump in her throat, it was not painful to swallow but she could feel the pressure with swallowing. She stated that she did not experience shortness of breath, but regardless, she was seen in the ER and she was given IV SOLUMEDROL, and BENADRYL, and she was watched for 5 or 6 hours and then she was sent home with an Epi Pen, around the clock Benadryl, and prednisone. She asked the ER doctors if they thought it was okay for her to receive the second dose of the product, and they told her to contact employee health for that question. She mentioned that she contacted that employee health and was told to contact her primary care provide which she did. Her primary care doctor instructed the caller to call Pfizer and gather some more information regarding ingredients, as the she may have had the reaction to a particular protein filler. She was also wondering if this is a known reaction to the product. She received the vaccine on 27Dec2020 at 2:15 PM. She reported that the red rash on her chest and arms, and her cheeks being flushed, resolved yesterday after receiving IV BENADRYL. Had a tightness and lump in her throat which was still ongoing, and it was kind of off and on and when the she takes Benadryl it goes away.

<td>PCR test positive for COVID-19 but no signs of COVID-19; PCR test positive for COVID-19 but no signs of COVID-19; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician reporting for himself. A 70-year-old male patient received the 1st  dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left, on 17Dec2020 at 09:00 AM, at single dose, for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension, high cholesterol, benign prostatic hyperplasia, drug allergy and food allergy all from unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient received unknown medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Historical vaccine included typhoid vaccine (unknown trade name) on unknown date and the patient experienced drug allergy. The day after vaccination with bnt162b2, on 18Dec2020 at 04:00 PM, the patient experienced PCR test positive for COVID-19 but no signs of COVID-19. The patient did not receive any treatment as a result of the event. The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included: COVID-19 PCR test positive (18Dec2020), nasal swab positive (18Dec2020). Outcome of the event was unknown.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of  COVID-19 PCR test positive  and suspected lack of efficacy due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.</td>

A 39-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 at single dose for prevention.  Medical history included none. There were no concomitant medications. Caller states, he received the covid vaccine 19Dec2020 and on 25Dec2020 he was experiencing left facial numbness, b/l foot numbness, b/l hand numbness on 26Dec2020, right side burning on 28Dec2020, Today (29Dec2020) he has had left thigh burning, and Left b/l gluteal burning and paresthesia. No motor issues and no tendon issues, all intact. Also had mid back burning on 28Dec2020 that comes and goes. He has heard that there is a described neuropathy with the virus and/or with the vaccine and wants more information on that. Curious if anyone has anything similar? and makes mention of possible Gillian Barre Syndrome. States that he has had a potential reaction. He had his dose on 19Dec2020. On 25Dec2020 he developed left facial numbness, then later that day he developed bilateral foot numbness. On 26Dec2020, he developed bilateral hand numbness, on 28Dec2020 he developed right thigh burning, and today (29Dec2020) he has developed left thigh burning, and bilateral gluteal burning and paresthesia. States that he has been kind of freaking out about it. He doesn&#39;t have any motor issues. States that he heard that there is a described neuropathy with the virus, but not with the vaccine, is that true? The left facial numbness resolved on either 26Dec2020 or 27Dec2020. States that the symptoms were concerning because it could have been a stroke. States his symptoms were moderate. States that due to the bilateral foot and hand numbness, he had a LP, brain and spine MRI, and blood work done on 26Dec2020. All came back completely normal. When asked about causality, caller states that it makes the most sense for his symptoms to be caused by the vaccine due to his age and the fact that all his testing was completely normal. Reporter seriousness for left facial numbness, bilateral foot numbness, bilateral hand numbness, right thigh burning, left thigh burning and bilateral gluteal burning and paresthesia: Medically significant. The outcome of the event left facial numbness was recovered in Dec2020. The outcome of the events guillain barre syndrome, stroke and mid back burning was unknown. The outcome of the other events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship the association between the reported serious adverse events with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

<td>Vaccine exposure during pregnancy; Partial placenta previa; This observational study case, received on 30-Oct-2020 from other health professional and concerned a 28-year-old, female, pregnant subject of body weight: 133 lbs, height: 63.3 inches and body mass index (BMI): 23.3, enrolled in a prospective observational safety study.  The subject&#39;s concurrent conditions included anxiety, acid reflux and morning sickness. The subject&#39;s past medications included Bonjesta (doxylamine succinate, pyridoxine hydrochloride) for morning sickness, nexium and famotidine both for acid reflux. The subject&#39;s concomitant medications included Dexilant (dexlansoprazole), cimetidine and sucralfate for acid reflux, citalopram from anxiety, Phenergan (promethazine) and Zofran (ondansetron) for morning sickness and prenatal plus DHA (vitamins nos, docosahexaenoic acid) for pregnancy.  The subject&#39;s obstetrical history included one previous pregnancy with one full term live birth. The subject had no history of offspring with major congenital malformation (MCM). The subject had no maternal or paternal medical history with MCM. The subject did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.   The subject&#39;s last menstrual period (LMP) date was 24-Jun-2020. The subject&#39;s estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 31-Mar-2021 and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was reported as 01-Apr-2021. The type of pregnancy was singleton.   On 25-Aug-2020, the ultrasound revealed no MCM.  On 02-Sep-2020, the counsyl chromosome 13, 18, 21 plus sex chromosome analysis and ultrasound revealed no MCM.  On 12-Oct-2020, at approximately 15 weeks of gestation (calculated per LMP), the subject was vaccinated with Afluria QIV (Flu Vaccine Egg Split QIV) (influenza vaccine; dose, route of administration and anatomical location: not reported) (explicitly coded as &#39;Vaccine exposure during pregnancy&#39;) for an influenza immunisation. The batch number reported was P100253284.   On the same day, the maternal serum alpha fetoprotein screening (MSAFP/Serum marker) revealed borderline elevation for spina bifida and it was unknown if MCM was noted.  On 20-Oct-2020, the MSAFP/Serum marker - repeat revealed no MCM.  On 03-Nov-2020, the ultrasound revealed partial placenta praevia and fluid collection near left kidney related to baby.  On 01-Dec-2020, the ultrasound revealed MCM: lymphangioma of foetus.  The outcome of the event &#39;placenta praevia&#39; was not reported.  The reporter did not provide a causality assessment.  The event of &#39;placenta praevia&#39; was considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus&#39;s Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  This case is linked with case 202008416, due to the corresponding baby case.  Additional information received from other health professional on 21-Dec-2020 with additional document received on 29-Dec-2020: Two additional lab tests added. Placenta praevia added as event and case was upgraded from non-serious to serious. Fluid collection near left kidney related to baby and lymphangioma noted as baby case opened. The narrative was amended accordingly.  Company comment: A 28-year-old, female, pregnant subject  experienced placenta praevia approximately 28 days after administration of Afluria QIV. The subject&#39;s concurrent conditions included anxiety, acid reflux and morning sickness. Concomitant medications included Dexilant (dexlansoprazole), cimetidine and sucralfate for acid reflux, citalopram from anxiety, Phenergan (promethazine) and Zofran (ondansetron) for morning sickness and prenatal plus DHA (vitamins nos, docosahexaenoic acid) for pregnancy. Causality is assessed as  not related due to chronological implausibility. Vaccine exposure during pregnancy is assessed as unrelated per company conventions.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Company comment: A 28-year-old, female, pregnant subject  experienced placenta praevia approximately 28 days after administration of Afluria QIV.

Loss of vision occurred while standing.  Referral to primary care and ophthalmology specialist found normal eye exam and MRI of orbits but  presence of tachycardia especially while standing (fluctuations between 60 beats at rest/laying down to 130 beats per minute standing).   Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)  is suspected.  Currently pursuing cardiac workup with cardiologist and Covid POTS specialist.

<td>Felt slight warmth throughout body about 5 minutes after vaccine. Disappeared 2 minutes later. Arm started to feel sore as the day went on and was very sore by nighttime. Next day, arm started to feel better and over the next 3 days was no longer sore.  On the morning of the 30th, woke up feeling fine, took a 3.5 mile walk and felt fine. Around 12:30 pm, experienced sudden pain and a burning sensation in the chest and both upper arms. Thought it was possibly heartburn ; took a Prilosec. The discomfort (mild but steady) continued so checked blood pressure which was 141/91. Called cardiologist and went to emergency room per instruction, around 1:30. Admitted overnight with the diagnosis of a mild heart attack and performed a heart catheterization where they found no major blockage. One artery noted 30% blocked but that overall heart function looked good. Discharged on 12/31/2020. -reported by patient via email, on 1/3/2021 @ 4:49pm</td>

She was diaphoretic and her chest was very red and she kept scratching and rubbing it at it. I asked if she wanted IM Benadryl or epipen and she at first denied. She also said she felt like she needed to focus on her breathing. At this time we decided it was best to administer Epipen x 1 dose. Immediately after she felt better. She was observed for another 30 minutes and then went home. at 7:17pm I called and spoke with her. She said her arm was sore and that her oxygen levels were about 88-89% which is low for her but she said she felt fine and is currently working right now.</td>

Immediately after the injection in her left shoulder, she began to feel warmth and numbness in her left shoulder, arm, neck, face, and chest. She reports later experiencing nausea, palpitations, and left arm weakness. Her symptoms persisted, and her family noted a left sided facial droop which prompted her ED visit.    In the ED, patient was noted to have some left sided facial droop and left arm and leg weakness. CT head and CTA showed no acute abnormalities. Tele-neurology was consulted who recommended admission to rule out acute stroke.  Ultimately, work up was negative and symptoms resolved.

I realized when sharp pain was felt at the digit. After about 5 minutes the digit felt numb. I got in my car, turned on the heater, and massaged my finger. Sharp pain was felt again as circulation returned to the digit. The event last approximately 10 minutes from the moment I realized the finger was pale until color returned.   This occurred again on 12/27 at around 2 PM as I walked from my car into a store at a temperature of about 40 degrees. This time, discoloration occurred bilaterally on my left 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits and my right 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits.  The event lasted more than 15 minutes with constant massaging.   This has occurred two more times since then, both times occurring bilaterally with minimal exposure to cold.</td>

On an unspecified date, her weight was between 97 and 98 pounds. Her pertinent medical history included a memory changed to the right temporal lobe, a Chinese viral infection which caused her a fever of 104.5 (units not provided), scar tissue which was formed during the viral infection (also reported as &quot;unsure if she was born with it&quot;), and epilepsy for 27 years. Concomitant medications included clobazam (ONFI).  Since approximately 1994 (also reported as when she was 6-year-old), the patient started therapy with phenobarbital for epilepsy (dose, frequency, route of administration, lot number and expiration date were not reported). This was the most helpful drug to treat her epilepsy; nevertheless, its levels had gone up naturally, she was unsure of how many times she had been high on it. It was also mentioned that she had cheated on her phenobarbital treatment.   On an unknown date, therapy with lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) was started (dose, frequency, route of administration, lot number and expiration date were not reported). On an unspecified date of September 2018, in order to go to school, the patient was vaccinated by a student with measles, mumps, and rubella (wistar ra 27-3) virus vaccine, live (M-M-R II) for prophylaxis (dose, route of administration, vaccination scheme frequency, anatomical location, lot number and expiration date were not reported).   On an unknown date of September 2018 (also reported as 2 weeks after receiving measles, mumps, and rubella (wistar ra 27-3) virus vaccine, live (M-M-R II)) the patient&#39;s lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) increased to 14 (units not provided) (also reported as &quot;her lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) went high&quot;) (anticonvulsant drug level increased) which made her behaviorally off (abnormal behavior). Consequently, the patient got to the emergency room (ER) and then she was hospitalized due to the event of anticonvulsant drug level increased. It was reported that she was repeating the same people&#39;s names over and over (repetitive speech) and she was moving around a little (restlessness). A nurse and a friend helped to calmed down her. Later, a doctor asked her if the had cheated on her phenobarbital; nevertheless, she told them that she did not this time. She explained that the difference between phenobarbital and lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) when they went up was that with phenobarbital she would get delusion and made up delusions in her head and she could remember everything; in contrast, with lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) she could not remember much (amnesia). On an unspecified day, a lab test (unspecified) was performed by some students and it was found that &quot;her levels were low&quot; (anticonvulsant drug level decreased); however, the patient was wondering if the students did the test correctly. The patient stated that on an unspecified date of September 2018, she had her vagus nerve stimulated since she was getting nervous (vagus nerve disorder, nervousness). On an unspecified date of September 2018, she recovered from anticonvulsant drug level increased after 7 days of hospitalization and she was discharged from the hospital on day 8.   The patient was asking if the COVID vaccine (unspecified) would interfere with her lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) phenobarbital and clobazam (ONFI) levels. She was also asking if fever is a possible side effect of the COVID vaccine (unspecified), because if the fever would be between 101-102 (units unspecified) she would propbably present seizures and would need to be hospitalized.  During the call, it was reported that the patient was difficult to understand and mumbled a lot; furthermore, many attempts of clarification had to be made and she had to be redirected multiple times in the conversation and she went off track often (speech disorder).  It was not reported if the patient received any treatment for the aforementioned adverse events.   The action taken with phenobarbital, and lamotrigine (LAMICTAL), the outcome of the event of speech disorder, repetitive speech, vagus nerve disorder, nervousness, restlessness, amnesia, and anticonvulsant drug level decreased and the causal relationship between the event and therapy with the suspect theapies were not reported.

The patient stated that he/she had located very minimal information on a link with Shingrix and Horner&#39;s Syndrome and he/she had Horner&#39;s and the onset coincides with receiving dose 1 of Shingrix. The patient had a brain scan, lung scan and carotid artery scan to rule out tumors as a cause of the Horner&#39;s Syndrome and the scans had all been good, but his/her right eye was affected with partial closing and he/she was experiencing headaches, pretty much constantly. The patient wanted to know if we had any reported information on a link with Shingrix and, if so, was that information we would share with patient. The patient was concerned about the financial aspect of all the testing, concerned about the constant headaches and also about the eye and certainly, concerned about the 2nd dose. The patient mentioned that he/she did like information to get an idea of how long this might last and if it would resolve and wanted to let him/her know if we had any information.</td>

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the Covid-19 shot 8 days ago on 15Dec2020. She tested positive for COVID on 23Dec2020. She worked in the emergency room, clarified she was a certified Nurse Assistant (CNA). She was hesitant about taking the COVID-19 vaccine. She was curious since she has been around the virus 24/7 since the pandemic started since she works in the emergency room. When she took the COVID-19 shot, stated she felt great the next day and could not sleep at night in Dec2020 which is not normal for her. It&#39;s nothing like the flu shot. It was strange since she has been around the virus all this time, she felt like she had COVID in Feb2020, but she was not tested then. She does not ever get sick and she was down for two days with a fever in Dec2020. After those two days, she always had a low-grade fever of 98 or 99 which was constant. After she took the COVID vaccine her temperature was normal, her temperature was lower around 96 or 97 in Dec2020. She woke up on 23Dec2020 and she had congestion and her temperature was still low. She went to work, and she was told she looked like she had no sleep. She was coughing 23Dec2020 morning, but she did not have any symptoms as far as temperature. She realized that the COVID 19 shot is only 50% effective. She is asking if she should get the second dose. The outcome of events was unknown.</td>

Even though she had the Covid virus, people said if you already have the virus you don&#39;t need to get a shot but people were encouraging because that&#39;s she thought well she guess she will get it. But she was mad that she got because it made her sick in Dec2020. And because we already got it they want us to go back and get the second shot and what she was m trying to say to you is, without take and hour 3 hour of conversation here she just want to say she don&#39;t want to get back and get the second shot and if it is okay by you guys somehow send her a letter or whatever it is, whoever she have to talk to because she don&#39;t want to go back and get the second shot just because of getting sick.

On 23Dec2020 at 06:45 AM, the patient experienced immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands; flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands. She was monitored by colleagues for an hour, prescription for Epi pen refilled, and available angioedema and fatigue persisted for three days. It was reported that the patient was not treated for the adverse events but it was also reported that the AE treatment also included X-ray and antibiotic. Outcome of the events was recovered in Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands, flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate</td>

Swelling was concentrated around eyes and cheeks the most. Both right and left side of the face and neck were affected. However, the right side face had a more pronounced reaction. MD ordered oral prednisone and Benadryl as treatment plan. Also, ordered episode-pen for a worst case scenario. Symptoms have been improving under treatment but still persist some. The events were reported as non-serious. The adverse event start date was 24Dec2020 (as reported). The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event angioedema was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile and temporal relationship.

<td>Relapse of MCD; frothy urine; periorbital edema; 24 hour proteinuria  was 1.5 gram; Initial information was received on 24-Dec-2020 regarding an unsolicited valid serious case from the other healthcare professional issued from a literature article.   This case involved a 45-year-old female patient who had relapse of MCD (Minimal Change Disease) (glomerulonephritis minimal lesion) with frothy urine (urine abnormality), periorbital edema (periorbital oedema) and her 24 hour protein urine was 1.5 gram (proteinuria), after she received INFLUENZA VACCINE.  The patient&#39;s medical history included abrupt onset of bilateral hand, facial, lower extremity edema and frothy urine and she was diagnosed with MCD after kidney biopsy on an unknown date of Dec-2014 (ongoing).   Urinalysis (UA) showed 3+ protein and urine protein to creatinine (UPCR) was 6.5.  Serum albumin was 1.5 g/dL (grams per deciliter), total cholesterol 465 mg/ dL, WBC (white blood cell) 6.79 K/mm (1000 per millimeter), hemoglobin (Hgb) 14.5 g/dL, platelets 417 K/mm, BUN (blood urea nitrogen) 20 mg/ dL, creatinine 1.0 mg/dL, AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase ) 29 iU/L (International units per liter), ALT (Alanine Transaminase) 20 iU/L, C3 (complement component 3) 155 mg/dL and C4 29.3mg/dL. RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin), hepatitis B &amp; C serologies, and ANA (Antinuclear Antibody) were negative. After approximately 2 weeks, UPCR worsened to 12 g/g.  The patient&#39;s past medical treatment included oral prednisone 1mg/kg (milligram per kilogram) daily, torsemide with 5mg/day and rosuvastatin with 5mg/day for MCD.  Complete remission of proteinuria was documented 2 weeks later and persisted after completing a 6-month course of prednisone.  The patient had no other significant medical or allergy history and no signs of systemic infection. She was normotensive and she denied recent infections or use of NSAID (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).  The patient&#39;s past vaccination(s), family history and concomitant medication were not reported.  The patient remained in complete remission until Oct-2016.  On an unknown date of Oct-2016, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer (batch number and other dosing details were not reported) for prophylactic vaccination.  On an unknown date of 2016, the patient experienced serious relapse of MCD in the absence of other potential triggers of MCD(glomerulonephritis minimal lesion) with frothy urine (urine abnormality), periorbital edema (periorbital oedema) and her 24-hour protein urine was 1.5 gram (proteinuria), just after administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE. These events were assessed as medically significant.  The patients renal and hepatic chemistries were normal with creatinine 0.7 mg/dL except for serum albumin of 3.0 g/dL. UA showed protein 100 mg/dL.  The patient was treated with oral Prednisone 50mg/day from an unknown date of 2016.  The patient had recovered from proteinuria within 21 days after treatment with Prednisone and at the time of reporting, outcome was not reported for other events.   It was reported that, this case as well as previous anecdotal reports suggested that influenza vaccination and the resulting stimulation of the immune system may cause MCD.  There will be no information available on the batch number for this case.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns 45-year-old patient who presented with relapse of glomerulonephritis minimal lesion, just after vaccination with INFLUENZA VACCINE (produced by unknown manufacturer). The time to onset is compatible. However, the patient already had same events before vaccination and information regarding past vaccination, its tolerance and concomitant medications were needed to fully assess the case. Based upon the reported information, the role the vaccine cannot be assessed.</td>

This A 30-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EH9899), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 22Dec2020 09:00 for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included reaction to pork, porsine and/or if she ever was exposed to exposed to heparin. There were no concomitant medications. On 23Dec2020, the patient experienced syncope (medically significant), dizziness (medically significant), feeling faint; like going to pass out now and then (medically significant), overall achiness, severe headaches, fever. The outcome of the events syncope, dizziness, feeling faint; like going to pass out now was recovering and outcome of overall achiness, severe headaches, fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The patient ask: are there any animal products, pork gelatin or a lipid form of that contain in the vaccine?   The events were described as follows: She experienced a significant amount of syncope and dizziness, for greater than 4 or 5 days post-receiving the vaccination. Also feeling faint like she is going to pass out every now and then. Has a more important question, wondering along with the doctors if one of the ingredients may have an animal product, like pork gelatin or a lipid form of that. It looks like one of the ingredients may have an animal cell lipid and was wondering if she was having a reaction to that. Declines to provide primary care provider details. States she received this first dose at occupational health in her workplace. Received the vaccine on the 22Dec2020 at 9am. 24 hours post vaccination, 1 day after, the syncope, dizziness, feeling faint started. Also the other symptoms, overall achiness, severe headaches, and fever were also experienced, but they stopped after that 24 hours. Those were expected since it was listed as side effects that popped up, so she expected those and they stopped after 24 hours. The syncope, dizziness, and faint feeling are not any worse and are very slowly improving, but she still has it and had to call out of work today because of it. That&#39;s consistent. Mentions it takes her a while to get down the stairs when getting product details for the COVID-19 vaccine. Unable to provide the vaccine NDC or expiry, or dose. Did not have any other vaccines at time of this one and none 4 weeks prior. Had to call a (company withheld) doctor and has to go to occupational health tomorrow to be seen. Declines having COVID virus.

They were thinking because the day before their vaccination they already had like some kind of congestion and also some kind of dry cough but they didn&#39;t really think that it was Covid but they were still able to get the vaccination on Monday. When they started to feel like they were not tasting anything, that&#39;s when they decided to get tested and it turns out to be positive. They were confirmed positive on the 25th but in their mind they were probably having Covid since the day before they got they vaccination. So their worry is, is there any effect where they got the vaccine where they already have the Covid in their body. So that is really their worry right now.

<td>blurred vision; little spots on the inside of her eyelids; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 53-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; batch/lot number and expiry date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included eyeglasses wearer (reported as with her glasses). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient is experiencing symptoms from the COVID-19 vaccine received on 18Dec2020. She began to have blurred vision that night, and it worsened over the following weekend. She saw the eye doctor on 22Dec2020, and they stated her vision had changed even with her glasses. Now she has little spots on the inside of her eyelids that were also noticed on the eye examination in Dec2020. She has already reported these symptoms to the V-safe program. She mentioned that she is not the only nurse in the workplace that has experienced blurry vision. She asked if she should receive the second dose on 08Jan2021. It was still blurry, but it was better than it was a week ago. It still affected her reading and seeing at a distance. It scared her to get the second one because she doesn&#39;t want to go blind. She went to the eye doctor for visit on Tuesday. The outcome of the event blurred vision was recovering, while for the other event was unknown. The reporter considered blurred vision as serious due to being medically significant.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that the reported event vision blurred and eyelid disorder related to the suspect product event most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors</td>

<td>Swelling arm/ swelling down to their biceps after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine; arm soreness/ soreness in their arms after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine; light redness around the vaccine injection site; body felt cold; felt real tired right after; fell asleep quickly; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A female patient of an unspecified age received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 13:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported the patient got the COVID-19 Vaccine at the same time as her husband did, and she had some symptoms afterwards, but her symptoms went right away. It was reported both she and her husband had soreness in their arms after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said a micro needle was used when the COVID-19 Vaccine was administered to both her and her husband&#39;s left upper arms. It was also reported both her and her husband had swelling down to their biceps after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the swelling went away on both of their left arms after 12-14 hours. It was also reported the husband and his wife continuously monitored each others vaccine injection sites. She said the husband used a LED light to look at her left upper arm, and saw a light redness around her vaccine injection site. The husband said the light redness around the vaccine injection site went away in 2 hours after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. It was reported her body felt cold after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine on 28Dec2020, and that she felt real tired right after she noticed her body felt cold. The husband said his wife fell asleep quickly on 28Dec2020, which is not normal for her, and slept for awhile. The husband said after she woke up she was fine. It was reported their arm swelling and soreness didn&#39;t really effect either one of them right away. He said the vaccine injection site redness for his wife started about 45minutes to an hour after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said they both started to feel the soreness in their left arms later. He said he  could feel the soreness at the vaccine injection site when he moved his left arm. He said it was the same for his wife when she moved her left arm, clarifying it was a very subtle feeling of soreness. The outcome of the events was recovered.  Lot/Batch has been requested.</td>
